Python implementation of a Magic: the Gathering card segmentation and recognition

General description of the algorithms and several example can be found in my blog:

TODO:
- Expects a folder and not an image name to analize. it will not run any detection
  if you give it a jpg file name because it appends it to the path you supply.
- Generate phash for other sets
- Remove hard-coded paths
- actually do arg pasring for reference images
- put results.txt into the output folder.
- figure out what is different between my reference images and the ones used.
  resolution?
